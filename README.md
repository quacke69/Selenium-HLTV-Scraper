# [WIP] Selenium-HLTV-Scraper
 Attempt at a Selenium-based HLTV stat scraper. The general idea is to create a program that can open a series of HLTV matches, and collect a series of statistics for the players that participated. The initial purpose of this is to conduct in-depth statistical analysis on how various statistics for various players correlate with how much their respective teams win games. 
 
 Included in the repo is chromedriver for macOS with ARM64 and Chrome version 106. If you're using another OS, a macOS-device without an Apple Silicon-processor, or a different version of Chrome, install the appropriate driver from [this link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). 
 
 If you wish to use a different browser, please adjust lines 7-8 accordingly.
